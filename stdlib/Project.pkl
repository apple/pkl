/// A manifest that defines the presence of a project.
///
/// A project is useful for defining [dependencies], and also for defining common evaluator
/// [settings].
///
/// A project is a directory that contains a project file at its root.
/// The project file is a file named `PklProject` exactly, that amends or embeds `"pkl:Project"`.
///
/// When evaluating from the CLI, the project directory can be specified explicitly using
/// `--project-dir` flag, or is determined implicitly by walking up the working directory, looking
/// for a directory containing a `PklProject` file.
///
/// When using the API libraries (e.g. _pkl-swift_, _pkl-go_ or _pkl-config-java_), the project must be
/// explicitly stated via the evaluator builder.
///
/// ## Embedding [Project]
///
/// In a project file, instead of amending `pkl:Project`, it is possible simply set the
/// `output.value` property of a module to an instance of [Project].
/// This allows defining higher levels of abstraction that encapsulate an underlying [Project]
/// definition.
///
/// When defining an abstraction, it is important to:
///   1. Set the module's `output.value` to the underlying project output.
///   2. Set [projectFileUri] to the enclosing module's URI.
///      This is necessary to determine the correct project directory, as well as for resolving
///      local project dependencies correctly.
/// 
///      The [newInstance()] helper method exists as a convenient way to set this when embedding
///      project definitions.
///
/// Example:
/// ```
/// module MyTeamProject
///
/// import "pkl:Project"
///
/// /// The package name, to be prefixed with `myteam`.
/// packageName: String
///
/// project: Project = (Project.newInstance(module)) {
///   package {
///     name = "myteam.\(packageName)"
///   }
/// }
///
/// output {
///   value = project
/// }
/// ```

/// The dependencies of this project.
///
/// A dependency is a group of Pkl modules and file resources that can be imported within the
/// project.
/// Within the project, a dependency can be referenced via _dependency notation_, where the name
/// is prefixed with the `@` character.
///
/// For example, given the following descriptor:
///
/// ```
/// dependencies {
///   ["birds"] {
///     uri = "package://example.com/birds@1.0.0"
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This enables the following snippet:
///
/// ```
/// import "@birds/canary.pkl" // Import a module from the `birds` dependency
/// 
/// birdIndex = read("@birds/index.txt") // Read a file from the `birds` dependency
/// ```
///
/// A dependency's coordinates can either be specified in the form of a [RemoteDependency]
/// descriptor, which gets fetched over the network, or an import of another PklProject file, which
/// represents a package that exists locally.
///
/// Remote dependencies are fetched over HTTPS.
/// When fetching a remote dependency, two HTTPS requests are made.
/// Given dependency URI `package://example.com/foo@0.5.0`, the following requests are made:
///
///   1. `GET https://example.com/foo@0.5.0` to retrieve the metadata JSON file.
///   2. Given the metadata JSON file, make a GET request to the package URI ZIP archive.
/// 
/// If this project is published as a package, these dependencies are included within the published
/// package metadata.
///
/// ## Local project dependencies
///
/// A local project can alternatively be used as a dependency.
/// This is useful when structuring a single repository that publishes multiple packages.
///
/// To specify a local project dependency, import the relative `PklProject` file.
/// 
/// The local project dependency must define its own [package].
///
/// Example:
/// ```
/// dependencies {
///   ["penguins"] = import("../penguins/PklProject")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Resolving dependencies
///
/// Dependencies must be _resolved_ before they can be used.
/// To resolve dependencies, run the CLI command `pkl project resolve`.
/// This will generate a `PklProject.deps.json` file next to the `PklProject` file.
///
/// ### Minimum version selection
///
/// Pkl uses the
/// [minimum version selection algorithm 1](https://research.swtch.com/vgo-mvs#algorithm_1)
/// to resolve dependencies.
/// A dependency is identified by its package URI, as well as its major semver number.
///
/// To determine the resolved dependencies of a project, the following algorithm is applied:
///   1. Gather all dependencies, both direct and transitive.
///   2. For each package's major version, determine the highest declared minor version.
///   3. Write each resolved dependency to sibling file `PklProject.deps.json`.

/// Note that command line flags passed to the CLI will override any settings defined here.
///
/// Other integrations can possibly ignore these evaluator settings.
