/// APIs for working with `pkl-binary` encoding.
///
/// `pkl-binary` is a binary encoding of Pkl data.
/// It can be used to encode all values, with the exception of [Function] types (lambda
/// expressions).
///
/// `pkl-binary` encoding is useful for separating evaluation and data consumption into two
/// separate steps.
/// For example, applications can produce `pkl-binary` at build time, and deserialize this into
/// code-generated structs at application runtime.
///
/// The `pkl-binary` format uses MessagePack encoding.
/// Its specification is available at
/// <https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/bindings-specification/binary-encoding.html>.

  /// Renders [value] as `pkl-binary`.

  /// Every `pkl-binary` value is also a valid document.
