// Ideally, this should have the same error message as `invalidFileUri2`; the error is that the glob
// pattern is invalid.
//
// But, this is somewhat challenging to fix, because the `URISyntaxException` gets thrown before
// `ImportGlobNode` is initialized.
//
// Regardless, this error is good enough (given this error message, users know what to do), and we
// can afford to be pragmatic here.
