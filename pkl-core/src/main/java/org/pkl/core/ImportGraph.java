/**
 * Java representation of {@code pkl.analyze#ImportGraph}.
 *
 * @param imports The graph of imports declared within the program.
 *     <p>Each key is a module inside the program, and each value is the module URIs decalred as
 *     imports inside that module. The set of all modules initialized within the program is the set
 *     of keys in this map.
 * @param resolvedImports A mapping of a module's in-language URI, and the URI that it resolves to.
 *     <p>For example, a local package dependency is represented with scheme {@code
 *     projectpackage:}, and (typically) resolves to a {@code file:} scheme.
