== Highlights [small]#💖#

News you don't want to miss.

[[windows-support]]
=== Windows Support

Pkl is now available on Windows! (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/492[#492])


In addition to macOS and Linux, Pkl is now available for download on Windows operating systems.

For installation instructions, consult xref:pkl-cli:index.adoc#windows-executable[Windows Executable] in the CLI reference.

==== Writing cross-platform Pkl programs

On Windows, the in-language filepath separator is still `/`.
This means that most existing Pkl code should still continue working as-is.

A small portion of programs will need to be updated to handle Windows support correctly.
One example is the various conversion scripts that read input files as CLI flags.

For example, here is a snippet from module https://github.com/apple/pkl-pantry/blob/d9571cdce407bb7f1687f81b945a4bfd24ce017d/packages/k8s.contrib/convert.pkl#L100C1-L103C74[k8s.contrib.convert]:

.convert.pkl#L100-L103
[source,pkl]
----
local inputUri =
  if (input.startsWith(Regex(#"\w+:"#))) input      // absolute URI
  else if (input.startsWith("/")) "file://\(input)" // absolute file path
  else "file://\(read("env:PWD"))/\(input)"         // relative file path
----

On Windows, the env var `PWD` is a Windows-style path, like `C:\Foo\Bar\Baz`.
With the above logic, `inputUri` can expand to a value like `"\file://C:\Foo\Bar\Baz/input.yaml"`.
This would an invalid URI; the correct URI should be `"\file:///C:/Foo/Bar/Baz/input.yaml"`.

Here is a possible fix for this code:

[source,pkl]
----
import "pkl:platform"

local inputUri =
  if (input.startsWith(Regex(#"\w+:/"#))) input
  else if (input.startsWith("/")) "file://\(input)"
  else
    let (pwd = read("env:PWD"))
    let (
      path =
        if (platform.current.operatingSystem.name == "Windows")
          "/\(pwd)/\(input)".replaceAll("\\", "/")
        else "\(pwd)/\(input)"
    )
      "file://\(path)"
----

[[http-proxying]]
=== HTTP proxying

Pkl now supports proxying HTTP(S) requests (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/506[#506]).

For users of the CLI, Pkl will by default look for proxy settings configured within the OS when on macOS, Windows, and GNOME environments.

This can be changed by adding settings in the following locations:

1. xref:pkl-cli:index.adoc#settings-file[Settings file]
2. xref:language-reference:index.adoc#projects[PklProject file]
3. `--http-proxy` and `--http-no-proxy` CLI flags

As part of this, some changes have been made to the standard library. For details, see <<standard-library-changes,Standard Library changes>>.

Users of the Java/Kotlin bindings can specify proxy settings when building an <<http-java-client,HTTP client>>.

HTTP proxy settings are also added as new fields in the message-passing-api.
Authors of external Pkl clients are encouraged to support these new fields to provide proxy support in their libraries.
For details, see <<message-passing-api-changes,Message passing API changes>>.

To read more about the design of HTTP proxying, consult https://github.com/apple/pkl-evolution/blob/main/spices/SPICE-0004-HTTP-Proxy-Support.adoc[SPICE-0004], and also the xref:pkl-cli:index.adoc#http-proxy[documentation].

[[scheme-agnostic-project-dependencies]]
=== Scheme-agnostic project dependencies

Improvements have been made to project dependencies (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/486[#486]).

A project dependency is a way to manage `package`-based modules.
It provides two uses:

1. A package can be imported through xref:language-reference:index.adoc#dependency-notation[dependency notation].
2. Conflicting versions in the transitive dependency graph are resolved.

Currently, dependencies can only be used with file-based modules.
This can be limiting in some circumstances:

1. JVM library users typically interact with Pkl by bundling Pkl files a classpath resources, and load them using `modulepath:` URIs.
2. Go library users often embed Pkl code using the https://pkg.go.dev/embed#hdr-Directives[`go:embed` directive], and load them using https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/apple/pkl-go/pkl#WithFs[`WithFs`].

This means that these users miss out on the benefits of project dependencies.

Pkl 0.26 adds support for using dependencies in any hierarchical module scheme.
This means that `modulepath:` users in Java can now declare projects and dependencies.
This also means that other custom methods of embedding modules can also use dependency notation.

[NOTE]
====
A _hierarchical_ URI is a URI whose path part starts with `/`, and in which `/` delimits path segments.

The URI `myscheme:/foo.pkl` is hierarchical, whereas the URI `myscheme:foo.pkl` is not.
====

To read more about this design, consult https://github.com/apple/pkl-evolution/tree/main/spices/SPICE-0005-scheme-agnostic-projects.adoc[SPICE-0005].

[[typealias-scoping-fix-and-change]]
=== Typealias scoping fix and change

Improvements have been made to `typealias`es (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/144[#144], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/373[#373], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/516[#516]).

Currently, a typealias that references a value on its enclosing module will break if used in another module.

.myModule.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
typealias StartsWithFoo = String(startsWith(foo))

foo = "foo"
----

[source,pkl]
----
import "myModule.pkl"

myStr: StartsWithFoo = "fooey"
----

This results in error:

[source]
----
–– Pkl Error ––
Cannot find property `foo`.

1 | typealias StartsWithFoo = String(startsWith(foo))
----

This is a language bug that has been fixed.

In the process of fixing this bug, we realized that the rules around variable resolution within typealiases were problematic.
Typealiases are meant to be statically defined, and shouldn't be able to see properties that can be late-bound.
Thus, a new rule is introduced: a typealias can only reference properties/methods that are `const`.

This is a breaking change. To read more about this breakage and remediation steps, reference <<typealiases-are-treated-as-const>>.

== Noteworthy [small]#🎶#

Ready when you need them.

[[pkldoc-improvements]]
=== Pkldoc improvements

The following improvements have been made to xref:pkl-doc:index.adoc[Pkldoc]:

1. The documentation for the standard library no longer shows dependent packages, because every package implicitly depends on the standard library (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/503[#503]).
2. If the standard library exists in the package list, it is shown first (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/165[#165]).
3. Fewer characters are percent-encoded. For example, the `(` and `)` characters are no longer percent-encoded (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/489[#489]).

[[standard-library-changes]]
=== Standard library changes

To support <<http-proxying,http proxying>>, several changes have been made to the standard library (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/506[#506]).

* Module `pkl.settings` has new property `http`.
* class `EvaluatorSettings` originally in `pkl.Project` has been moved to its own module.
For backwards compatibility, `pkl.Project` now has a `typealias EvaluatorSettings` pointing to the new module, but it is marked `@Deprecated`.

=== Java API Changes

[[http-java-client]]
==== HTTP Java Client

A new Java API is introduced, named `org.pkl.core.http.HttpClient` (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/217[#217], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/295[#295], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/506[#506], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/518[#518]).
This interface provides the ability to manage how Pkl makes HTTP(S) calls, including how it deals with CA certificates, as well as proxies.

This client can be passed to Pkl's evaluator using `EvaluatorBuilder` for users of pkl-core, and `ConfigEvaluatorBuilder` for users of pkl-config-java or pkl-config-kotlin.

[[http-module-key-factory]]
==== New HTTP ModuleKeyFactory

A new module key factory for HTTP(S) modules has been added (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/495[#495]), and can be built with `org.pkl.core.ModuleKeyFactories#http`.

The preconfigured evaluator (`org.pkl.core.EvaluatorBuilder#preconfigured`) includes this module key.
Users that build their own evaluator from scratch should add this module key factory if HTTP(S) modules are needed.

Example:

[source,diff]
----
 import org.pkl.core.EvaluatorBuilder;
 import org.pkl.core.module.ModuleKeyFactories;

 var evaluator = EvaluatorBuilder.unconfigured()
+  .addModuleKeyFactory(ModuleKeyFactories.http) // <1>
   .build();
----
<1> Add `ModuleKeyFactories.http` to the set of module key factories used by this evaluator.

If this module key factory is not added, Pkl may still make HTTP(S) requests if `ModuleKeyFactories.genericUrl` is included.
However, this bypasses proxy and CA certificate settings.

[[pkl-executor-changes]]
==== `pkl-executor` changes

A new set of parameters are now available to `org.pkl.executor.Executor` (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/217[#217], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/518[#518]).
These new parameters are exposed by `org.pkl.executor.spi.v1.ExecutorSpiOptions2`.

The new parameters are:

* `certificateFiles`: A set of CA certificate files to trust when making HTTPS requests.
* `certificateBytes`: A set of PEM-encoded CA certificate bytes to trust when making HTTPS requests.
* `testPort`: An option that is used for internal testing only.

These options are ignored when using a Pkl distribution whose version is lower than 0.26.0.

[[message-passing-api-changes]]
=== Message passing API changes

A new property, `http`, is added to xref:bindings-specification:message-passing-api.adoc#create-evaluator-request[Create Evaluator Request] (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/506[#506], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/518[#518]).

This allows for the configuration of Pkl's HTTP proxy, as well as CA certificates.

[[rename-codegen-classes]]
=== Ability to rename classes produced by Java/Kotlin code generators

The Java and Kotlin code generators have a new option that allows users to change the name of Java/Kotlin classes that get produced during code generation (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/499[#499]).

The CLIs have a new flag, `--rename`, and the Gradle plugin receives a similarly named property called `renames`.

This option accepts a map from an old prefix to a new prefix, where longer prefixes have higher precedence than shorter prefixes.

For example, when generating `module foo.Bar`, specifying `--rename foo.=com.foo.` will cause the Java/Kotlin code generators to emit package `com.foo`, and class `Bar`.

== Breaking Changes [small]#💔#

Things to watch out for when upgrading.

[[typealiases-are-treated-as-const]]
=== Typealiases are treated as `const`

A breaking change has been made to typealiases (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/516[#516]).

Typealiases are types that can stand in for another type declaration.

The aliased type can have constraints, where these constraints can reference values defined on the enclosing module.

.baseModule.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
typealias MyValue = Any(isValid) // <1>

isValid = true
----
<1> `isValid` is defined on the enclosing module.

One problem with this is that typealiases are meant to be statically defined.
Like classes, typealiases should not be changed by amending its enclosing module.

[source,pkl]
----
amends "baseModule.pkl"

isValid = false // <1>
----
<1> Despite this amended value, `typealias MyValue` should still stand for `Any(true)`.

To have clearer semantics, a new rule is introduced: referenced members on the enclosing module must be `const`.
Effectively, a typealias is treated as if it is also a `const` member.

To fix the above typealias, the `const` modifier should be added to `isValid`.

[source,diff]
----
 typealias MyValue = Any(isValid)
 
-isValid = true
+const isValid = true
----

It might not always be valid to add the `const` modifier.
For example, this property may be overwritten in a downstream module, so adding the `const` modifier this would break that module.
In these cases, another fix is to self-import the enclosing module.
This works because import declarations introduce values that are implicitly marked `const`.

.baseModule.pkl
[source,diff]
----
+import "baseModule.pkl" // <1>
+
-typealias MyValue = Any(isValid)
+typealias MyValue = Any(baseModule.isValid)
 
 isValid = true
----
<1> Self import

This change aligns with the behavior of class and annotation bodies.

To read more about the rationale behind this change, consult https://github.com/apple/pkl-evolution/blob/main/spices/SPICE-0007-const-checks-in-typealiases.adoc[SPICE-0007].

[[expanded-dependency-notation-uris]]
=== Expanded dependency notation URIs

The parsing of relative path imports has changed (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/486[#486]).

Currently, the declaration `import "@foo/bar.pkl"` is treated as the import of a dependency named `foo`, but _only_ when declared within file-based and package-based modules.
In an HTTP-based module, for example, the above import is treated as "bar.pkl inside directory @foo".

To <<scheme-agnostic-project-dependencies,improve project dependencies>>, such declarations are treated as dependency notation in all modules, and will fail with error "Cannot find dependency".

Any import/reads that are intentionally relative-path imports will need to be updated to be prefixed with `./`.

Example:

[source,diff]
----
-import "@bar/foo.pkl"
+import "./@bar/foo.pkl"
----

[[minimum-java-version-bump]]
=== Minimum Java version bumped to Java 17

The minimum Java version for Pkl has been bumped to Java 17 (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/439[#439]).

This means that when running the xref:pkl-cli:index.adoc#java-executable[jpkl] CLI, the installed `java` is expected to be Java 17 or higher.
This also means that users of the JVM libraries need to be on at least Java 17 or higher.

[[minimum-gradle-version-bump]]
=== Gradle plugin minimum version bump

The minimum Gradle version for the xref:main:pkl-gradle:index.adoc[Gradle plugin] is now 8.1 (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/454[#454]).

[[path-encoding-changes]]
=== Path encoding changes

In order to support Windows, the output of some Pkl tools have unsafe characters encoded in a special format (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/489[#489]).

On Windows, the characters `<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `\`, `|`, `?`, and `*` are reserved and cannot exist in a filename.
Additionally, the ASCII control character code points `0x0` through `0x1f` are also illegal.

These characters are encoded by wrapping their hexadecimal code point value in parentheses.
For example, the character `:` is encoded as `(3a)`.

In some scenarios, files that get written to disk will be encoded.
These are:

* Files generated by Pkldoc.
* `*.kt` files produced by the Kotlin code generator.
* Packages written to the cache directory.

To learn more about this design, consult https://github.com/apple/pkl-evolution/blob/main/spices/SPICE-0003-windows-safe-paths.adoc[SPICE-0003].

==== Pkldoc links changes

The links generated by Pkldoc have changed.

For example, a module called `module `foo<bar`` creates file `foo(3c)bar.html`, instead of `foo<bar.html`.

As part of this change, some Pkldoc links have also changed.

==== Cache directory prefix changes

The cache directory has been changed from `<moduleCacheDir>/package-1` to `<moduleCacheDir>/package-2`.

If Pkl's dependencies are vendored within a repository, these dependencies will need to be re-vendored.

=== Java API Breaking Changes

The following Java APIs have breaking changes:

|===
|Class/method | Breaking change

|`org.pkl.cli.commands.CliDownloadPackageCommand`
|Renamed to `org.pkl.cli.commands.CliPackageDownloader`

|`org.pkl.cli.commands.CliAbstractProjectCommand`
|Renamed to `org.pkl.cli.commands.CliProjectCommand`

|`org.pkl.config.java.InvalidMappingException`
|Fields `pklName` and `javaName` are now `private`.

|`org.pkl.core.packages.PackageResolver#getInstance`
|New parameter `httpClient` added

|`org.pkl.core.repl.ReplServer.ReplServer`
|New parameter `httpClient` added

|`org.pkl.commons.cli.CliBaseOptions`
|New parameters `testPort`, `httpProxy`, `httpNoProxy` added
|===

[[standard-library-breaking-changes]]
=== Standard library breaking changes

Class `pkl.Project.EvaluatorSettings` has been removed.
A new (deprecated) typealias is added that points to new module `pkl.EvaluatorSettings`.
For both of these, see https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/506[#506].

[[type-checked-settings-file]]
=== Type-checked settings file

The loading of the xref:pkl-cli:index.adoc#settings-file[settings file] has changed (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/477[#477]).

The settings file is a way to control the behavior of the Pkl CLI.
This module is expected to `amends "pkl:settings"`, but this behavior was not checked.

In 0.26, it is an error if the settings module neither amends `"pkl:settings"`, nor set its `output.value` to an instance of the settings module.

[[empty-directories-excluded-from-packaging]]
=== Empty directories excluded from packaging

Currently, the `pkl project package` command will bundle empty directories into the resulting ZIP file.

In version 0.26, this has been changed to exclude these directories (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/330[#330]).
This means that the packages can produce a _different_ checksum if there are any empty directories.

This does not break the usage of existing packages, and does not affect compatibility of new packages used with older Pkl 0.25.

However, this can break certain workflows.
The `pkl project package` command runs a publish check, to determine if a package has already been published but with a different checksum.
When upgrading, users might encounter an error message like the following:

[source]
----
-- Pkl Error --
Package `package://example.com/foo@1.0.0` was already published with different contents.
----

To mitigate, the package's version needs to be bumped, even if package contents have not changed.

== Miscellaneous [small]#🐸#

The following changes have been made that are neither new features nor breaking changes.

* Pkl's user-agent header for HTTP requests has been tweaked to add a semicolon (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/221[#221]). Here is an example difference:
+
Before: `Pkl/0.26 (macOS native)` + 
After: `Pkl/0.26 (macOS; native)`
* Documentation improvements (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/120[#120], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/121[#121], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/142[#142], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/121[#121], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/337[#337], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/341[#341], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/372[#372], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/386[#386], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/391[#391], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/397[#397], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/422[#422], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/436[#436], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/469[#469], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/484[#484], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/485[#485], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/[#491]).
* Optimization: `const` access is checked when variables are resolved, instead of every time the variable is accessed (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/438[#438]).
* Optimization: use logical AND instead of bitwise AND when comparing numbers (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/102[#102]).
* Mark Java classes `final` (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/458[#458]).
* Migrate code to newer JDK17 features, and clean up existing Java code (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/451[#451], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/458[#458], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/512[#512]).
* Improve rendering of string values within generated `<file>.pkl-expected.pcf` files when running `pkl test` (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/416[#416]).
* Improve performance of loading Pkl's built-in CA certificates (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/518[#518]).

== Bug Fixes [small]#🐜#

The following bugs have been fixed.

* `Collection#sortWith` produces un-sorted output (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/394[#394]).
* Property `typedType` in module `pkl.reflect` reflects upon `Type`, instead of `Typed` (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/426[#426]).
* `const` members can be assigned to when via an object spread  (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/428[#428]).
* Relative globbed reads resolve to the same value in different modules (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/449[#449]).
* Performance bug: globbed imports and globbed reads expand to an unbounded number of root nodes (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/449[#449]).
* Relative globbed imports within a package match no modules (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/496[#496]).
* Constraints within typealiases resolve to the wrong values (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/144[#144]).
* Members of `pkl.reflect` cannot be rendered (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/170[#170], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/470[#470]).
* Throws `NullPointerException` if "List Resources Response" or "List Modules Response" messages contain both null `pathElements` and `error` (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/480[#480]).
* Classes of `com.oracle.truffle` are not shaded in pkl-config-java-all and pkl-tools (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/238[#238]).
* Throws `PklBugException` when running publish check on an invalid URL (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/441[#441]).
