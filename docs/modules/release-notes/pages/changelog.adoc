[[release-0.26.2]]
== 0.26.2 (2024-07-18)

=== Fixes

* Fixes a possible race condition where multiple concurrent Pkl evaluations results in a thrown exception when downloading packages (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/584[#584]).

[[release-0.26.1]]
== 0.26.1 (2024-06-28)

=== Fixes

* Fixes a regression where native executables fail to run on some environments that don't support newer CPU features (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/551[#551]).
* Fixes a `PklBugException` when passing `.` as a project directory to `pkl project resolve` and `pkl project package` (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/544[#544]).

=== Changes

* Disable revocation checking of TLS certificates (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/553[#553]).
+
As part of HTTP improvements in 0.26, we unwittingly fixed a bug where Pkl does not actually perform cert revocation checks when making HTTPS requests.
This fix, unfortunately, caused a regression in some cases.
For example, this happens when connecting to a server that bears a public trust certificate, while in an environment with no internet access.
This is because the HTTP client needs to check the revocation status of all certificates in the chain.
+
Revocation checks are a nuanced topic with some benefits, and also with its own problem areas.
For this reason, revocation checking is disabled for Pkl's native CLIs.
Users of Pkl's Java APIs will respect the revocation settings set in the JVM.
