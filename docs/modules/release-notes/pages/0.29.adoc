[[bytes-standard-library-class]]
=== `Bytes` standard library class

A new standard library class is introduced, called `Bytes` (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1019[#1019]).

Currently, Pkl does not have a built-in way to describe binary data.
In situations where binary data is needed, the common pattern is to use a Base64 string.
This is sufficient in simple cases, but still introduces many shortcomings:

1. `pkl eval` can only produce UTF-8 encoded strings.
2. It is not possible to compute the checksum of binary content (except in the case of `read()`).
3. It is hard to interop with configuration formats that allow binary data.
4. It is hard to do transformations on binary data.

To address these shortcomings, the `Bytes` class is introduced.
This is a data type representing a sequence of bytes.

[source,pkl]
----
myBytes = Bytes(0x48, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x2c, 0x20, 0x57, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x6c, 0x64, 0x21) // <1>
----
<1> ASCII bytes for the string "Hello, World!"

To learn more about this feature, consult https://github.com/apple/pkl-evolution/blob/main/spices/SPICE-0013-bytes-standard-library.adoc[SPICE-0013].

==== Emitting binary output

A new property called `bytes` is added to `FileOutput`.
The CLI has been changed to evaluate this property, and write its contents to the designated output location.

This change means that Pkl modules can now output binary content.
For example, here is a simple module that outputs bytes:

[source,pkl]
----
output {
  bytes = Bytes(1, 2, 3, 4) // <1>
}
----
<1> Write bytes 1, 2, 3, 4

The same change applies when evaluating in multiple-file output mode.

[source,pkl]
----
output {
  files {
    ["foo.bin"] {
      bytes = Bytes(1, 2, 3, 4) // <1>
    }
  }
}
----
<1> Write bytes 1, 2, 3, 4 to a file called `foo.bin`.

==== Rendering `Bytes`

Out of the box, only the `plist` and `pcf` formats are able to render `Bytes`.
For other formats, a renderer needs to be defined.

[source,pkl]
----
output {
  renderer = new JsonRenderer {
    [Bytes] = (it) -> it.base64 // <1>
  }
}
----
<1> Render bytes as a base64 string in JSON.

==== Using `Bytes` from language bindings

Users of Pkl's language bindings also benefit from the new type.
When using code generation, the `Bytes` data type will turn into the following types:

|===
|Language |Type

|Java
|`byte[]`

|Kotlin
|`ByteArray`

|Go
|`[]byte`

|Swift
|`[UInt8]`
|===

Maintainers of other language bindings are encouraged to map `Bytes` into the corresponding binary type in their language.

==== `Bytes` versus `List<UInt8>`

Conceptually, `Bytes` is very similar to `List<UInt8>`, because both are data types that describe sequences of `UInt8` values.
However, they have different performance characteristics.
A `List` is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure[persistent data structure].
This means that creating modified copies of lists is very cheap.

However, lists have more overhead per element.
A `List<UInt8>` with 1000 elements takes up about 5.4 kilobytes of heap space, whereas the same data in `Bytes` takes roughly 1 kilobyte.

=== HTTP Rewrites and Package Mirroring

A new evaluator setting is introduced, which rewrites URLs before making outbound HTTP calls (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1062[#1062], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1127[#1127], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1133[#1133]).

This setting can be configured via CLI flag `--http-rewrite`, and also in other ways:

* A builder option in `org.pkl.core.EvaluatorBuilder`
* A builder option in `org.pkl.executor.ExecutorOptions`
* A new property in `CreateEvaluatorRequest` in the Message Passing API
* A new property in the Gradle plugin
* A new property in `pkl.EvaluatorSettings#Http`

The main use-case for this setting is to enable package mirroring.
For example, let's assume that the following mirrors exist:

|===
|Original |Mirror

|\https://pkg.pkl-lang.org
|\https://my.internal.mirror/pkg-pkl-lang

|\https://github.com
|\https://my.internal.mirror/github
|===

A user of the CLI can use these mirrors with the following settings.

.~/.pkl/settings.pkl
[source,pkl]
----
amends "pkl:settings"

http {
  rewrites {
    ["https://pkg.pkl-lang.org/"] = "https://my.internal.mirror/pkg-pkl-lang/"
    ["https://github.com/"] = "https://my.internal.mirror/github/"
  }
}

== Noteworthy [small]#🎶#

Ready when you need them.

=== pkldoc, pkl-codegen-java, pkl-codegen-kotlin executables

The pkldoc, pkl-config-java and pkl-config-kotlin CLIs are published as their own executables (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1023[#1023]).

Currently, these tools have excellent support when called from within the pkl-gradle plugin.
However, the story for using these as CLIs is much clunkier.
Users must call Java by including their published `.jar` files, as well as all of their dependencies via the `-classpath` argument.

In 0.29, they are all being published as executables.
In particular, pkldoc is being published as both a Java executable and a native executable.
On the other hand, pkl-codegen-java and pkl-codegen-kotlin are published as Java executables only.

For more information, see their download instructions:

* xref:pkl-doc:index.adoc#install-cli[pkldoc]
* xref:java-binding:codegen.adoc#install-cli[pkl-codegen-java]
* xref:kotlin-binding:codegen.adoc#install-cli[pkl-codegen-kotlin]

=== Java API changes

==== Resource Readers SPI added to preconfigured evaluators

A change was made to the preconfigured evaluators (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1094[#1094]).

Currently, they add module key factories from service providers, but not resource readers.

This means that users of pkl-spring, for example, cannot add custom resource readers.
This is also inconsistent (in the preconfigured evaluator, import can use custom schemes, but not read).

In Pkl 0.29, any resource reader registered via the Service Provider Interface will be added to the preconfigured evalutors.

==== New methods

New methods are introduced to the Java API.

* `org.pkl.core.Evaluator.evaluateOutputBytes`
* `org.pkl.core.http.HttpClient.Builder.setRewrites`
* `org.pkl.core.http.HttpClient.Builder.addRewrite`
* `org.pkl.executor.ExecutorOptions.httpRewrites`
* `org.pkl.config.java.ConfigEvaluatorBuilder.getHttpClient`
* `org.pkl.config.java.ConfigEvaluatorBuilder.setHttpClient`

=== Standard Library changes

New properties, methods, classes and typealiases have been added to the standard library (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1019[#1019], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1053[#1053], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1063[#1063], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1144[#1144]).

==== Additions to `pkl:base`

* {uri-stdlib-String}#isBase64[`String.isBase64`]
* {uri-stdlib-String}#base64DecodedBytes[`String.base64DecodedBytes`]
* {uri-stdlib-String}#encodeToBytes()[`String.encodeToBytes()`]
* {uri-stdlib-List}#mapNonNullIndexed()[`List.mapNonNullIndexed()`]
* {uri-stdlib-List}#toBytes()[`List.toBytes()`]
* {uri-stdlib-Set}#mapNonNullIndexed()[`Set.mapNonNullIndexed()`]
* {uri-stdlib-FileOutput}#bytes[`FileOutput.bytes`]
* {uri-stdlib-Resource}#bytes[`Resource.bytes`]
* {uri-stdlib-Mapping}#getOrDefault()[`Mapping.getOrDefault()`]
* {uri-stdlib-Listing}#getOrDefault()[`Listing.getOrDefault()`]
* {uri-stdlib-baseModule}#Charset[`Charset`]
* {uri-stdlib-Bytes}[`Bytes`]

==== Additions to `pkl:EvaluatorSettings`

* {uri-stdlib-evaluatorSettingsHttpClass}#rewrites[`Http.rewrites`]

==== Additions to `pkl:reflect`

* {uri-stdlib-reflectModule}#bytesType[`bytesType`]

=== `pkl` CLI changes

New features are added to the `pkl` CLI (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1052[#1052], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1056[#1056]).

==== Aggregated JUnit reports

A new set of CLI flags are introduced: `--junit-aggregate-reports`, and `--junit-aggregate-suite-name`.
Collectively, these flags tell Pkl to combine the JUnit reports into a single file, instead of creating a file per Pkl module.

Thanks to https://github.com/gordonbondon[@gordonbondon] for contributing to this feature!

==== shell-completion subcommand

A new subcommand called `shell-completion` has been added to the Pkl CLI.

This command produces autocompletion scripts for a given shell.

The following example installs shell completions for https://fishshell.com[fish shell]:

[source,shellscript]
----
pkl shell-completion fish > "~/.config/fish/completions/pkl.fish"
----

Thanks to https://github.com/gordonbondon[@gordonbondon] for contributing to this feature!

=== `@Generated` annotation for Java/Kotlin codegen

Classes generated by the Java and Kotlin code generator can optionally recieve new annotation called `Generated` (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1075[#1075], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1115[#1115]).

This behavior is toggled with the `--generated-annotation` CLI flag, or the similarly named Gradle property.

When enabled, classes are annotated with `org.pkl.config.java.Generated`.

This allows users of JaCoCo to exclude Pkl-generated classes from coverage reports.

== Breaking Changes [small]#💔#

Things to watch out for when upgrading.

=== Standard library deprecations

The following methods have been deprecated in the standard library:

|===
|Method name |Details

|`Resource.md5`
|Replaced with `Resource.bytes.md5`

|`Resource.sha1`
|Replaced with `Resource.bytes.sha1`

|`Resource.sha256`
|Replaced with `Resource.bytes.sha256`

|`Resource.sha256Int`
|Replaced with `Resource.bytes.sha256Int`
|===

=== Grammar changes

New rules have been introduced to the parser (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1022[#1022], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1126[#1126]).

==== Block comment nesting is removed

Currently, block comments can be nested.
For example, the comment `/* /* my comment */ */` is two block comments; one outer comment and one inner comment.

However, this has some drawbacks.

1. Block comments can be possibly be closed incorrectly, like `/* /* my comment */`. However, this is a valid block comment in most languages.
2. Pkl's syntax highlighters do not support block comment nesting, leading to highlighting that is inconsistent with Pkl's parser.

To improve user experience, block comment nesting is removed.
As a result, block comments are always terminated upon the first `*/`.

==== Shebang line can only appear at the start of a file

The grammar around shebang comments has been made stricter. 

Pkl files allow for a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)[shebang comment].
Currently, this comment can appear anywhere in a file.
In 0.29, this comment must appear at the start of a file.

=== Opaque `file:` URIs are invalid

A new rule is introduced to treat opaque `file:` URIs as errors (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1087[#1087]).

Opaque file URIs are URIs whose scheme-specific part does not start with `/`.
For example, `file:foo/bar.txt` is an opaque URI.

Currently, this has the unintentional behavior of: look for file `foo/bar.txt` from the process working directory.
These are effectively dynamics imports; from a single import, we can't statically determine what file is actually being imported.

According to https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8089#section-2[RFC-8089], `file` URIs must have paths that start with /.
So, these are actually not valid URIs.

In Pkl 0.29, it is an error to load a module or resource with an opaque `file:` URI.

NOTE: To import or read a relative path, omit `file:` from the import string. For example, `import("foo/bar.txt")` instead of `import("file:foo/bar.txt")`.

=== New base module names: `Bytes` and `Charset`

Two new names are introduced to the base module: `Bytes` and `Charset`.
That means that any code that currently references these names on implicit `this` will break (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/1019[#1019]).

The following snippet demonstrates this breaking behavior.
In 0.28 and below, `obj2.prop` resolves to string "my bytes".
In 0.29, it resolves to class `Bytes` in the base module.

[source,pkl]
----
obj1 {
  Bytes = "my bytes"
}

obj2 = (obj1) {
  prop = Bytes
}
----

To make this code continue to have the same meaning, an explicit `this` reference is required.

[source,diff]
----
 obj1 {
   Bytes = "my bytes"
 }
 
 obj2 = (obj1) {
-  prop = Bytes
+  prop = this.Bytes
 }
----

This only affects code that references these names off of implicit this.
Code that references the name from the lexical scope will continue to work as-is.
