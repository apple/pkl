== Highlights [small]#üíñ#

News you don't want to miss.

=== New parser

Pkl has greatly improved its parsing speed by introducing a new parser (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/917[#917]).

The first step to evaluate a program is to parse its source code into a parse tree.
Currently, Pkl uses https://www.antlr.org[ANTLR] to generate parser code from grammar files.

Using this approach has allowed for rapidly iterating and changing the language's grammar.
However, Pkl's grammar has matured; it's not as likely that the grammar will change from one version to the next.
Additionally, the current parser's performance has become more painful as projects written in Pkl grow in size.
In many cases, parsing can take up most of the time spent during evaluation.

In 0.28, ANTLR is being replaced by a handwritten parser.
This improves parsing speed by around two orders of magnitude.
Here are some quick comparisons between the two parsers, run on a MacBook Pro M4 Max machine, with 5 warmup iterations, and run for 10 iterations:

|===

|136.7msfootnote:[In the `pkl` native executable, the standard library is parsed during compilation rather than during evaluation. As a result, there is no parsing overhead.]

Ready when you need them.

=== CLI improvements

==== Colored help messages

The `pkl`, `pkldoc`, `pkl-codegen-java`, and `pkl-codegen-kotlin` CLIs now emits help text with colors (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/947[#947]).

Here is a sneak peek:

Thanks to https://github.com/gordonbondon[@gordonbondon] for their contribution!

==== `jpkl` support on Windows

The `jpkl` executable is now supported on Windows (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/872[#872]).

`jpkl` is a fat jar that can be executed directly when on macOS and Linux, but current users of Windows are required to pass this file as the `-jar` to Java.

In 0.28, Windows users can also call execute this command directly.

=== Java 22+ support

Pkl's Java libraries now support Java 22 and higher (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/876[#876]).

Thanks to https://github.com/sgammon[@sgammon] for their contribution!

=== Standard library additions

==== `math.atan2()`

The `pkl:math` standard library module has a new method, called {uri-stdlib-mathModule}/index.html#atan2()[atan2] (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/819[#819]).
It computes the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2[2-argument arctangent].

=== Overhauled for-generator implementation

The implementation for for-generators has been overhauled (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/844[#844]).

This fixes some known bugs with the current for-generator implementation, and also improves code health by reducing complexity and removing workarounds and band-aids.

=== Java code generator improvements

Improvements have been made to the code generators (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/792[#792]).

The `--params-annoatation` flag now accepts `none` as a value, which causes the code generator to skip adding annotations to a constructor's parameters.

Additionally, these annotations will not be added if the `--generate-spring-boot-config` flag is set.

This is useful for those compiling Java code with the `-parameters` flag set, because the pkl-config-java library is able to map into these classes without any extra annotations.

=== pkldoc improvements

The pkldoc has a new flag, `--no-symlinks`. 

=== `jar:nested:` URIs are accepted by default

To improve integration with Spring Boot, the Pkl evaluator by default now accepts module URIs starting with `jar:nested:` (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/895[#895]).

The `--allowed-modules` flag (and the equally named option in other APIs) can be used to configure the set of allowed modules.

== Breaking Changes [small]#üíî#

Things to watch out for when upgrading.

=== Stricter grammar

As a result of implementing a new parser, the following previously accepted grammar is no longer valid (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/917[#917]).

==== Inline object entries require a semicolon

An xref:language-tutorial:01_basic_config.adoc#entries[_entry_] is one of the three types of object members that can inhabit an object. 

When declaring multiple entries on the same line, a semicolon is now required to separate them.

The following code snippet is currently valid, and becomes a syntax error in 0.28.

[source,pkl]
----
obj { ["one"] = 1 ["two"] = 2 }
----

To fix, insert a semicolon between the two entries:

[source,diff]
----
-obj { ["one"] = 1 ["two"] = 2 }
+obj { ["one"] = 1; ["two"] = 2 }
----

==== String escapes require correct number of pounds

When using xref:language-reference:index.adoc#custom-string-delimiters[custom string delimiters], the escape sequence becomes backslash (`\`) plus the number of pounds used to delimit the string.

However, due to a parser bug, an arbitrary number of pounds characters are currently accepted after the the solidus.

In Pkl 0.28, this becomes a syntax error.

[source,pkl]
----
foo = "foo \####(bar)"
----

==== Object spreads, for generators, and when generators require whitespace or semicolon separator

Inline object spreads, for generators, and when generators all now require either whitespace or a semicolon separator.

[source,pkl]
----
foo { ...bar...baz } // Syntax error
----

=== Minimum Gradle version bump

The minimum Gradle version for the xref:main:pkl-gradle:index.adoc[Gradle Plugin] has been bumped to 8.2 (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/901[#901]).

=== Java/Kotlin API breaking changes

Breaking changes have been made to the Java/Kotlin APIs (https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/748[#748], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/749[#749], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/776[#776], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/808[#808], https://github.com/apple/pkl/pull/810[#810]).

=== Fat jars no longer shade Truffle

Pkl publishes two fat jars to Maven Central: https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.pkl-lang/pkl-tools[pkl-tools], and https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.pkl-lang/pkl-config-java-all[pkl-config-java-all].

Due a version bump in the Truffle library, the package `com.oracle.truffle` can no longer be shaded.

For users that use both Pkl and other Truffle languages, this means that their version of Truffle should match Pkl's version.
