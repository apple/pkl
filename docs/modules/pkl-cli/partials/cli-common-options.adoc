[[allowed-modules]]
.--allowed-modules
[%collapsible]
====
Default: `pkl:,file:,modulepath:,https:,repl:,package:,projectpackage:` +
Comma-separated list of URI patterns that determine which modules can be loaded and evaluated.
Patterns are matched against the beginning of module URIs.
(File paths have been converted to `file:` URLs at this stage.)
At least one pattern needs to match for a module to be loadable.
====

[[allowed-resources]]
.--allowed-resources
[%collapsible]
====
Default: `env:,prop:,package:,projectpackage:` +
Comma-separated list of URI patterns that determine which external resources can be read.
Patterns are matched against the beginning of resource URIs.
At least one pattern needs to match for a resource to be readable.
====

[[cache-dir]]
.--cache-dir
[%collapsible]
====
Default: `~/.pkl/cache` +
Example: `/path/to/module/cache/` +
The cache directory for storing packages.
====

.--no-cache
[%collapsible]
====
Disable caching of packages.
====

.-e, --env-var
[%collapsible]
====
Default: OS environment variables for the current process +
Example: `MY_VAR=myValue` +
Sets an environment variable that can be read by Pkl code with `read("env:<envVarName>")`.
Repeat this option to set multiple environment variables.
====

.-h, --help
[%collapsible]
====
Display help information.
====

.--module-path
[%collapsible]
====
Default: (empty) +
Example: `dir1:zip1.zip:jar1.jar` +
Directories, ZIP archives, or JAR archives to search when resolving `modulepath:` URIs.
Paths are separated by the platform-specific path separator (`:` on *nix, `;` on Windows).
Relative paths are resolved against the working directory.
====

.-p, --property
[%collapsible]
====
Default: (none) +
Example: `myProp=myValue` +
Sets an external property that can be read by Pkl code with `read("prop:<propertyName>")`.
Repeat this option to set multiple external properties.
====

.--root-dir
[%collapsible]
====
Default: (none) +
Example: `/some/path` +
Root directory for `file:` modules and resources.
If set, access to file-based modules and resources is restricted to those located under the specified root directory.
Any symlinks are resolved before this check is performed.
====

.--settings
[%collapsible]
====
Default: (none) +
Example: `mySettings.pkl` +
File path of the Pkl settings file to use.
If not set, `~/.pkl/settings.pkl` or defaults specified in the `pkl.settings` standard library module are used.
====

.-t, --timeout
[%collapsible]
====
Default: (none) +
Example: `30` +
Duration, in seconds, after which evaluation of a source module will be timed out.
Note that a timeout is treated the same as a program error in that any subsequent source modules will not be evaluated.
====

.-v, --version
[%collapsible]
====
Display version information.
====

.-w, --working-dir
[%collapsible]
====
Base path that relative module paths passed as command-line arguments are resolved against.
Defaults to the current working directory.
====

.--ca-certificates
[%collapsible]
====
Default: (none) +
Example: `/some/path/certificates.pem` +
Path to a file containing CA certificates to be used for TLS connections.

Setting this option replaces the existing set of CA certificates bundled into the CLI.
Certificates need to be X.509 certificates in PEM format.

For other methods of configuring certificates, see xref:pkl-cli:index.adoc#ca-certs[CA Certificates].
====

.--http-proxy
[%collapsible]
====
Default: (none) +
Example: `\http://proxy.example.com:1234` +
Configures HTTP connections to connect to the provided proxy address.
The URI must have scheme `http`, and may not contain anything other than a host and port.
====

.--http-no-proxy
[%collapsible]
====
Default: (none) +
Example: `example.com,169.254.0.0/16` +
Comma separated list of hosts to which all connections should bypass the proxy.
Hosts can be specified by name, IP address, or IP range using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation[CIDR notation].
