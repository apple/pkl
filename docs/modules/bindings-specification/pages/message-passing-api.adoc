= Message Passing API

include::ROOT:partial$component-attributes.adoc[]
include::partial$component-attributes.adoc[]

All messages are encoded in link:{uri-messagepack}[MessagePack], as an array with two elements.

The first element of the array is a code that designates the message's type, encoded as an int.
The second element of the array is the message body, encoded as a map.

Messages are passed between the _client_ and the _server_.
The _client_ is the host language (for example, the Swift application when using pkl-swift).
The _server_ is the entity that provides controls for interacting with Pkl.

For example, in JSON representation:

[source,json]
----
[
  1,                           // <1>
  { "someKey": "someValue" }   // <2>
]
----
<1> Code indicating message type
<2> Message body

== Message types

[[client-message]]
=== Client Message
A message passed from the client to the server.

[[server-message]]
=== Server Message
A message passed from the server to the client.

[[request-message]]
=== Request Message
A message sent with a `requestId` value.
The `requestId` should be a unique number at the time of message send.
The other side is expected to respond with a <<response-message>> with the same `requestId`.

[[response-message]]
=== Response Message
A message that is the response to a <<request-message>>.
It contains the same `requestId` of the request message.

[[one-way-message]]
=== One Way Message

A fire-and-forget message where no response is expected.

== Messages

All messages have their schema described in Pkl.
A nullable type means that the property should be omitted (as opposed to the property's value being `nil`).

[[create-evaluator-request]]
=== Create Evaluator Request

Code: `0x20` +
Type: <<client-message,Client>> <<request-message,Request>>

Create an evaluator with the provided evaluator settings.
Upon creating the evaluator, the server sends back a <<create-evaluator-response>> message.
