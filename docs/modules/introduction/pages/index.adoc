Pkl -- pronounced _Pickle_ -- is a configuration-as-code language with rich validation and tooling.
It can be used as a command line tool, software library, or build plugin.
Pkl scales from small to large, simple to complex, ad-hoc to recurring configuration tasks.

We created Pkl because we believe that configuration is best expressed in a special-purpose configuration language;
a middle ground between a static configuration format, and a general-purpose programming language.
