== Evolution

Sometimes, a change to Pkl is large enough that it makes sense to create a proposal for the change so that it can be discussed in detail and vetted.

Pkl has a process for managing such designs in a repository called {uri-pkl-evolution}[Pkl Evolutiuon].

== Roadmap

To discover what might be coming in future versions, reference the {uri-pkl-roadmap}[Pkl Roadmap] project on GitHub.

The roadmap describes estimates.
The Pkl team aims to cut a release in February, June, and October of each year.
If an item is not complete by the release cutoff date, the roadmap item may be bumped to the next release.

Additionally, as priorities change, it is possible that items can be moved around, or backlogged.
